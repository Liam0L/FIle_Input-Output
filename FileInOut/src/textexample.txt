Write a Java program to read and process a text file. 
The name of the text file is entered by the user. 
If the file does not exist, the program displays an error message and exits. 
Otherwise, the file is opened and read, keeping a count of the number of lines and total number of characters. 
These two values are displayed in a message box after the whole file has been read. 
After use, the file is closed. 
(Note that words are simply considered to be any text that is separated by spaces.)
